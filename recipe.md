This recipe will make enough dough for 4 small or 3 medium sized or 2 large pizzas. It’s great for preparing ahead of time keeping in the fridge overnight for when you’re ready to use!
First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and ½ teaspoon of sugar.

Usually instant yeast can be mixed directly in the flour or in water at room temperature. But I am detailing this method as it can be implemented if you are using dry active yeast. Add 2 teaspoons dry active yeast for this pizza crust recipe.
Add 1 cup of lukewarm water (44 degrees Celsius) and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.
You should start to see the yeast mixture bubbling up and doubling in size after about 10 to 15 minutes
Combine 1 cup of unbleached all purpose flour (or bread flour) with 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of olive oil
Stir with a whisk or wooden spoon or steel spoon
Add one more cup of the flour
Keep on stirring. The mixture will be quite sticky, like in the photo below
Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir. The dough will start to form and leave the sides of the bowl, but will still be sticky
ow it’s time to knead the dough by hand until it forms a smooth dough. Dust with flour to prevent sticking as you work. The dough will be soft and elastic, and no longer stickyKeep your dough in the deep bowl, and lightly apply a bit of olive oil all around the outside of the dough. This will keep it from sticking to the sides of the bowl once the dough proves and grows.

Cover loosely with a kitchen napkin or towel, and let rest at room temperature for the dough to leaven:

45 minutes to 1 hour for instant yeast
1.5 to 2 hours for dry active yeast
After exactly 1 hour my dough had risen and doubled up to what you see below.

If you plan to make the pizza the next day, then wrap the dough tightly in a plastic wrap and keep in the fridge.You can choose to either chop the tomatoes (500 grams or 5 to 6 medium tomatoes) and use them fresh to make the sauce, or blanch them first and then add in a blender. Blanching will reduce the cooking time, but is not necessary for making a delicious sauce.
Crush the raw or blanched tomatoes in the blender to make a puree that is as smooth or chunky as you like for this pizza recipe.
Now add the tomato puree, and mix well.
Cover the pan with lid and simmer the tomato sauce on low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have softened. If the sauce looks too thick you can add ¼ cup water. Then cover and continue to cook.
 Simmer until the tomatoes have completely cooked and the sauce has thickened
 Stir in herbs and crushed black pepper.

For the pizza sauce seasonings in this recipe, you can add ¼ cup chopped basil (or 3 to 4 teaspoons dried basil), 2 to 3 teaspoons dried oregano (or 2 tablespoons fresh oregano) and fresh crushed black pepper as needed. If you can I recommend using fresh herbs for the boldest Italian flavor.
Mix the sauce well and set aside.

You can allow the pizza sauce to completely cool and store in an airtight container for up to 10 to 15 days in the fridge, or 3 months in the freezer, and use anytime you’re ready to bake the pizzas.
